You can write code that runs at many different stages of an Astro project's lifecycle.
Including, but not limited to, configuration, parsing, building, static rendering,
server rendering, and client rendering.

Knowing at which point in the lifecycle your code _can_ run and at which point it _is_
running allows you to achieve some pretty cool things, both in terms of optimizations
and in terms of functionality. Some code that you write is not relevant at one phase
and can be skipped, some other code could behave differently depending on the phase.
This is not always very obvious, so here is some quick guidance on how to navigate
the Astro lifecycle.

If you have your code inside a `<script>` tag in your page, you can be sure that it
will run in the browser. Similarly, if your code is in the front-matter of an Astro
component, you know it will _not_ run on the browser. A code that you write inline
in your `astro.config.mjs` will clearly be executed during the configuration phase.
A piece of code in a remark plugin will run during the parsing phase of Markdown and
MDX files.

But what if you have your code in an independent `.ts` file? Some code that is shared
between different use cases. An arbitrary TS file can be imported from anywhere, be it
a `<script>` tag in your page, the front-matter of an Astro component, an Astro `.ts`
endpoint, an astro integration, a remark plugin, or a Vite plugin.

If that code should behave the same in any scenario where it is used, then you don't need
to worry about it. But in some cases, it might be useful to know how to identify _when_
and _where_ you are running. Not all those cases can be differentiated from all the
others, but some can.

## Why would I care?

Knowing where and when your code is running allows you to organize your code in a way
that is more maintainable, sharing code between different use cases by their semantic
meaning, instead of by their technical implementation. It also allows you to optimize
your code by skipping some code that is not relevant in some scenarios.

A few examples of this are:

- If you are reading data from a remote source dynamically based on user actions, you
  need to do it in the browser. But you can share the code that reads the data between
  the browser and the server, so the first render of the page can be done with the
  data already available.
- If your website utilizes authentication on multiple pages, you can move that logic to
  your middleware. But middlewares also run for every page during static rendering. You
  don't want to run authentication logic during static rendering, there won't ever be
  a session to authenticate, and any session you create will be lost. So you can skip
  that code during static rendering.
- If you are using a UI framework like React or Preact and want to use some browser API
  like `localStorage` or `history`, you need to do it in the browser. But you can share
  the code that uses those APIs between the browser and the server, so the entire render
  doesn't need to happen in the browser, an initial render can be done on the server.
- If you are writing a library that collects its use during static rendering to avoid
  work on request time, you need to switch between the code paths depending on the
  phase, but you can probably share some of the work. Like if you want to implement your
  own version of [`getImage`] and [`<Image />` component].

## Vite meta variables

Astro uses [Vite] to build projects, and Vite sets some variables in [`import.meta.env`]
to identify some of the conditions. Those variables are available in any code that is
loaded by Astro, from configuration to plusing, from build to browser code.

[`import.meta.env`]: https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html#env-variables
[Vite]: https://vitejs.dev/

But what is set in those variables depends on the phase of the lifecycle, some not entirely
obvious. Let's see what is set in each phase.

### On Astro configuration plugins

If you check those variables inside your `astro.config.mjs` file, you'll see that they
are set as such:

While running `astro sync` and `astro dev` the following variables are set:

- `import.meta.env.MODE` is set to `"development"`
- `import.meta.env.PROD` is set to `false`
- `import.meta.env.DEV` is set to `true`
- `import.meta.env.SSR` is set to `true`

While running `astro build`, `astro check` and `astro preview` the following variables
are set:

- `import.meta.env.MODE` is set to `"development"`
- `import.meta.env.PROD` is set to `true`
- `import.meta.env.DEV` is set to `false`
- `import.meta.env.SSR` is set to `true`

There are a few things to notice here already.

First, `import.meta.env.MODE` is set to `"development"` in all cases. This is because
Astro's project configuration is loaded in development mode, even when building for
production. Your project is built in production mode, but your configuration for
that build is itself built in development mode.

Second, `import.meta.env.SSR` is set to `true` in all cases. This is because although
the name of that variable is an acronym for "Server-Side Rendering" it _does not_ mean
that the code is running during an SSR. It just means that the code is not running in
the browser. This is important to keep in mind, because it means that you can't use
that variable to check if you are on the server, your code might be running on a static
build or on a plugin and that flag will be set.

Third, `import.meta.env.PROD` and `import.meta.env.DEV` are set relative to the mode
_your_ project will be built/validated/previewed in, not the mode your configuration
is running in.

### On a plugin (Vite, Remark or Rehype)

Astro loads plugins in the same context as your configuration. So a Remark, Rehype or Vite
plugin will see the same values in `import.meta.env` as your configuration.

But plugins are not always invoked. Remark plugins, for example, are invoked on
`astro dev` and `astro build`, but not on `astro sync`, `astro check` or `astro preview`.

This can be useful to skip some work when running in development, like indexing content
for search. During development, the content will change frequently and indexing everything
on every change is a waste of time.

[Starlight][starlight], the documentation framework this site is built upon, does
exactly that.
If you enable the search feature, it still won't index anything during development,
only when you build your side for production will it index all your pages and enable
the search functionality.

## Rendering phases

Your page can be rendered in four different phases, or any combination of them:

- **Static rendering**: the page is rendered at build time, and the resulting HTML
  is saved to disk.
- **Server rendering**: the page is rendered at request time _on the server_, and the
  resulting HTML is sent to the client.
- **Browser scripts**: the content of the page is built in the browser from some data.
  In Astro this is just vanilla JS that you run on the page to change what was received
  from the server.
- **Hydration**: this is a special case of the browser scripts, this is when a component
  from a UI framework like React or Svelte is hydrated in the browser inside an
  [Astro Island][Astro Island] to become interactive.

### Am I in the browser?

Checking if a piece of code is running in the browser is useful to know if you can
use browser APIs, like `history` or `localStorage`, if you can use DOM APIs, or where
is valid to track user activity in such environment. Some example scenarios where this
is useful are

- You want to modify some behavior based on the user's browser preferences, like
  a preferred color scheme, or reduced motion.
- You want to save the state of some incomplete user interaction.
- You want to decide whether to report some user activity to an analytics service,
  like tracking interactions with a form.

This is probably the easiest question to answer. Astro uses [Vite] to build your project,
and Vite sets some variables in `import.meta.env` to identify some of the conditions
we'll talk about here. In particular, `import.meta.env.SSR` is `true` when the code is
_not_ running in the browser and `false` when it is.

### Am I on the server?

Although Vite has the `import.meta.env.SSR` variable, which is an acronym for Server-Side
Rendering, checking if that is set to `true` does not guarantee that the code is running
in the server, or even during an SSR. It just means that the code is not running in the
browser.

So, how do we know if we are on the server? Well, we can check if we are in the browser
