import {Tabs, TabItem} from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import RequireViewTransition from '@require/viewTransitions.astro';

In our [last article], we took a deep dive into the browser's View Transitions API and
the problem it solves in the general case. Now, we'll start exploring what Astro has
built on top of that API and how all it's features were implemented to work together.

[last article]: /deep-dive/astro-view-transitions/browser-api/

And how are we going to do that? By creating our own `<ViewTransitions />` component from
scratch! We'll start with a simple component that intercepts navigation events and
transitions the page to the content of the new page. Then, we'll add more features to it
until we have a component that is as feature-complete as Astro's built-in component.

You might ask, 'why would I want to build my component?' That's a valid question.
Understanding how to create your component not only empowers you with flexibility and the
thrill of customization but also deepens your understanding of how the process works
under-the-hood. It's all about getting your hands dirty with code!

There's no need to worry about required knowledge or experience. I'll be breaking down
every step of the process and explaining the code snippets in detail. The full source code
of the project at the end if this guide is also available [here on GitLab][final code].
You can also see the code we are going to build in action on [StackBlitz][sb end].

The API being replicated in this article is the work of the Astro authors and specially
[Martin Trapp], the major author of Astro's View Transitions API. All credits go to them
for the API, the code, and specially the ingenuity in handling multiple quirks and edge
cases of the browser's navigation. Martin is also the author of View Transitions [Bag of
Tricks], a collection of tips and tricks to make the most of the View Transitions API,
and recently published the [`astro-vtbot`][vtbot] package, which provides reusable
components with some of the tricks he demonstrates on his page.

## Goals

In this article, we'll build a `<ViewTransitions />` component that intercepts all
navigation events and transitions the page to the content of the new page. In this journey
we'll learn how to:

- Intercept navigation events
- Load and parse a page from a URL
- Switch the page content in place

## Getting started

We'll build our component with the official [blog template] as a starting point. It's a
template that includes almost every use case that we'll cove in this series, so we can
focus on implementing the transitions component and not the page that uses it.

[blog template]: https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples/blog

If you want to follow along with your own code, you can do so in any Astro project, but
I recommend that you create a new project using the same base template. You can do so
with the `create-astro` package:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="npm">

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="pnpm">

```sh
pnpm create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Yarn">

```sh
yarn create astro@latest -- --template blog
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you don't want to install anything on your computer, you can use the template on
[StackBlitz][sb start] to follow along online.

## Folder structure

We'll create the component in a separate folder so we can provide our constant and methods
without polluting the Astro component file. We'll call this folder `viewTransitions` and,
for a start, we'll create the following structure:

- `index.ts`: Re-exportes of the component, all the constants and methods
  that consumers of the component will need.
- `component.astro`: The component itself.
- `client/`: The client-side code will be in a separate folder for better organization.
  - `index.ts`: Re-exports of the client-side constants and methods that consumers of
    the component can use.
  - `...`: Client side code.

:::note[Astro source]
This structure will allows to provide an overall API similar to Astro's built-in
component, but it is not the same structure that Astro uses internally.

Astro relies on Vite plugins to create the virtual module `astro:transition`, which
re-exports parts of this API defined in different places in the codebase. Their structure
makes more sense for the Astro codebase, which has multiple other utility modules and
components, but it is not as easy to follow for a standalone component.

<details>
<summary>Astro's structure</summary>

- [`/components/ViewTransitions.astro`][component source]: The component itself.
- [`/src/transitions/index.ts`][animation source]: Builders for built-in animations.
- [`/src/transitions/router.ts`][router source]: All the logic for navigation and page
  loading.
- [`/src/transitions/types.ts`][types source]: Common types used in multiple places.
- [`/src/transitions/vite-plugin-transitions.ts`][plugin source]: The Vite plugin that
  creates the `astro:transition` and `astro:transition/client` virtual modules.

</details>
:::

We'll add new files as we go. Let's complete the boilerplate code first:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/index.ts"
// Re-export the component for a better DX, similar to Astro's built-in component
export { default as ViewTransitions } from './component.astro';
```

If you are following along with the blog template, we can add our new component to every
page by changing the following file:

```astro title="src/layouts/BaseHead.astro" ins={5,12}
---
// Import the global.css file here so that it is included on
// all pages through the use of the <BaseHead /> component.
import '../styles/global.css';
import {ViewTransitions} from './viewTransitions';

// ... existing code
---
<!-- ... all the blog metadata -->
<meta property="twitter:image" content={new URL(image, Astro.url)} />

<ViewTransitions />
```

## Intercepting navigation

Since our goal is to provide an alternative to navigating to different pages, the first
thing we need to do is intercept the events of those navigation actions. Those events
can be clicking on a link, or by using the browser's back and forward functions. We'll
start by handling just the link clicks, going back and forth in the browser history will
cause a page reload for now.

To intercept links clicks, we could listen to the `click` event on every link in the page
that we are interested, but that would require multiple different listeners, and every
time anything adds a new link to the page, we'd have to add a new listener. Too much work,
too many chances for things to go wrong.

Instead, we'll listen to the `click` event on the entire `document`, and look around from
the event to see if it was on a link element:

```astro title="src/components/viewTransitions/component.astro"
<script>
// Listen to the click event on the entire document
document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Check if the click was on a link
  const link = event.target?.closest('a, area');
  if (!link) return;

  // Prevent the default behavior of the click event
  event.preventDefault();

  // Navigate to the link
  alert(`Would navigate to: ${link.href}`);
});
</script>
```

Notice that we are showing an alert with the URL of the link that was clicked for now.
Once we implement the navigation logic, we'll replace that alert with a call to our
`navigateTo` function.

But we don't want to intercept all the links in the page. We only want to intercept the
links that are internal to our site, external links should be handled by the browser as
usual. We can do that by checking if the link is pointing to the same origin as the
current page:

```astro title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={8-12}
<script>
// Listen to the click event on the entire document
document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // Check if the click was on a link
  const link = event.target?.closest('a, area');
  if (!link) return;
  
  // Resolve relative links
  const origin = new URL(link.href, location.href).origin;

  // Check if the link is to the same origin
  if (origin !== location.origin) return;

  // Prevent the default behavior of the click event
  event.preventDefault();

  // Navigate to the link
  alert(`Would navigate to: ${link.href}`);
});
</script>
```

Try it out! If you click on any internal link in the page, you'll see a message in the
console, but the page won't change. External links will work as usual.

### Link attributes

Ok, we got a handle for the basics, but we are not done yet. We need to handle a few extra
cases. Let's add them together. If the link has a `target` attribute it might be opening
in a new tab, or escaping an iframe; we should let the browser handle those cases.
Similarly, if the link has a `download` attribute, the page shouldn't navigate, the
browser should start the download.

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={6-18} del={4-5}
// Resolve relative links
const origin = new URL(link.href, location.href).origin;

// Check if the link is to the same origin
if (origin !== location.origin) return;
if (
  // Download links
  link.lasAttribute('download')
  // Links without a destination
  || !link.href
  // Links that don't target the current scope
  || (link.target && link.target !== '_self')
  // External links
  || origin !== location.origin
) {
  // Let the browser handle those cases.
  return;
}
```

### Mouse buttons and modifier keys

The user can also click on a link using the middle mouse button, or with a modifier key
like `Ctrl` or `Cmd` to open the link in a new tab, or `Shift` to open it in a new window,
or `Alt` to download the destination content.
If there are any modifier keys pressed, we should let the browser handle the navigation.

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={11-15}
if (
  link.lasAttribute('download')
  // Links without a destination
  || !link.href
  // Links that don't target the current scope
  || (link.target && link.target !== '_self')
  // External links
  || origin !== location.origin
  // Middle click, or other special click
  || event.button !== 0
  // Clicks with modifier keys
  || event.metaKey
  || event.ctrlKey
  || event.altKey
  || event.shiftKey
) {
  // Let the browser handle those cases.
  return;
}
```

### Cooperating with other listeners

Lastly, we should also check if the event was already handled by another event listener.
If the event was already handled and the default behavior was prevented, we shouldn't
try to navigate.

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={16-17}
if (
  link.lasAttribute('download')
  // Links without a destination
  || !link.href
  // Links that don't target the current scope
  || (link.target && link.target !== '_self')
  // External links
  || origin !== location.origin
  // Middle click, or other special click
  || event.button !== 0
  // Clicks with modifier keys
  || event.metaKey
  || event.ctrlKey
  || event.altKey
  || event.shiftKey
  // Event already handled
  || event.defaultPrevented
) {
  // Let the browser handle those cases.
  return;
}
```

### SVG links

That handler will work for most links, but it won't work for SVG links. In case the user
clicks on an `<a>` link inside an SVG, our code would break because the `target` and
`href` properties are different in SVG elements. We can fix that by checking if the
element is an HTML element, and if not, handle it as an SVG element:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={3-5,13} del={1-2,12}
// Resolve relative links
const origin = new URL(link.href, location.href).origin;
const linkTarget = link instanceof HTMLElement ? link.target : link.target.baseVal;
const href = link instanceof HTMLElement ? link.href : link.href.baseVal;
const origin = new URL(href, location.href).origin;

if (
  link.hasAttribute('download')
  // Links without a destination
  || !link.href
  // Links that don't target the current scope
  || (link.target && link.target !== '_self')
  || (linkTarget && linkTarget !== '_self')
  // External links
  || origin !== location.origin
  // Middle click, or other special click
  || event.button !== 0
  // Clicks with modifier keys
  || event.metaKey
  || event.ctrlKey
  || event.altKey
  || event.shiftKey
  // Event already handled
  || event.defaultPrevented
) {
  // Let the browser handle those cases.
  return;
}
```

### TypeScript

If you are using TypeScript, you'll get some errors in the code above. That's because
TypeScript doesn't know the type of the elements involved. We can fix that by properly
checking the type of the elements. Out entire component so far would look like this:

```astro title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={6-15} del={3-5}
<script>
  document.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    // Check if the click was on a link
    const link = event.target?.closest('a, area');
    if (!link) return;
    let link = event.target;
    if (link instanceof Element) {
      link = link.closest('a, area');
    }
    if (
      !(link instanceof HTMLAnchorElement) &&
      !(link instanceof SVGAElement) &&
      !(link instanceof HTMLAreaElement)
    )
      return;

    const linkTarget = link instanceof HTMLElement ? link.target : link.target.baseVal;
    const href = link instanceof HTMLElement ? link.href : link.href.baseVal;
    const origin = new URL(href, location.href).origin;
    if (
      link.hasAttribute('download')
      // Links without a destination
      || !link.href
      // Links that don't target the current scope
      || (linkTarget && linkTarget !== '_self')
      // External links
      || origin !== location.origin
      // Middle click, or other special click
      || event.button !== 0
      // Clicks with modifier keys
      || event.metaKey
      || event.ctrlKey
      || event.altKey
      || event.shiftKey
      // Event already handled
      || event.defaultPrevented
    ) {
      // Let the browser handle those cases.
      return;
    }

    // Prevent the default behavior of the click event
    event.preventDefault();

    // Navigate to the link
    alert(`Would navigate to: ${href}`);
  });
</script>
```

:::note[Astro source]
If you look at the [source code][click event source] for the `click` event handler in
Astro, you'll see that it uses one extra piece of information,
`link.dataset.astroHistory`. That is part of Astro's custom attributes that enable
declarative changes in navigation behavior. We'll cover those in a future article.

[click event source]: https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8a0def2b6c3d85ea8f91db8df9b17c9ea8ee3a0f/packages/astro/components/ViewTransitions.astro#L54-L93

## Loading the new page

Now that we have a way to intercept navigation events, we need to load the new page before
we can transition to it. The plan is to download the new page and parse it into DOM
elements without adding it to page just yet.

### Fetching the HTML

To load the page we first need to download its source. The `fetch` API has all the
features we
need, so let's write a little helper around it so we don't have to deal with the details
every time:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/navigation.ts"
type FetchedHTML = {
  html: string;
  mediaType: DOMParserSupportedType;

  /**
   * If there was a redirect, this will be the final URL of the page.
   */
  redirected?: string;
};

async function fetchHTML(href: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<FetchedHTML | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(href, init);

    const contentType = response.headers.get('content-type') ?? '';

    const mediaType = contentType.split(';', 1)[0].trim();

    if (mediaType !== 'text/html' && mediaType !== 'application/xhtml+xml') {
      // Not an HTML page that we can parse, let the browser handle it.
      return null;
    }

    const html = await response.text();

    return {
      html,
      mediaType,
      redirected: response.redirected ? response.url : undefined,
    };
  } catch {
    // If there is an error loading the page let the browser handle it and show the error
    // page to the user.
    return null;
  }
}
```

With this function we download the page and return if it is an HTML page. If it is not,
we return `null` so we can then yield to the browser and let it handle it. The key parts
of this function are:

- We specifically do not test the status of the response. If the next page is a 404 page
  or any other error page, we stil want to load it and transition to it.
- We use the `content-type` header to determine if the page is an HTML page.
  `content-type` encodes both a media type and multiple optional parameters, so we
  extract the media type from it and check against the supported HTML media types.
- If a request is redirected, we follow the redirects and return the final page with
  the final URL. We'll use this to update the URL in the browser's address bar to what
  it would be if the browser had handled the navigation.

:::note[Astro extreme edge case bug]
Astro's [`fetchHTML` function][fetchHTML bug] utilizes the regular expression `/;.*$/` to
drop the parameters of the `content-type` header. Although that works for the
_recommended_ encoding of the `content-type` header, the specification is more permissive
than that. Here is the relevant portion of the syntax as defined on the
[HTTP semantics RFC][http abnf]:

```txt
Content-Type = media-type

OWS = *( SP / HTAB )

media-type = type "/" subtype parameters

subtype = token
type = token

parameter = parameter-name "=" parameter-value
parameter-name = token
parameter-value = ( token / quoted-string )
parameters = *( OWS ";" OWS [ parameter ] )

tchar = "!" / "#" / "$" / "%" / "&" / "'" / "*" / "+" / "-" / "." /
 "^" / "_" / "`" / "|" / "~" / DIGIT / ALPHA
token = 1*tchar
```

As you can see, the `parameters` segment is preceeded by a `;` _and any number of optional
white spaces_. That means a server that sends a `content-type` header like
`text/html ; charset=utf-8` is within the specification, but would get dropped by Astro
as a non-html page.

[http abnf]: https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#appendix-A

[fetchHTML bug]: https://github.com/withastro/astro/blob/8a0def2b6c3d85ea8f91db8df9b17c9ea8ee3a0f/packages/astro/src/transitions/router.ts#L122-L125
:::

### Parsing the HTML

_From this section on we'll diverge from Astro's source code to allow for a more clear
explanation of the process. At the end we'll compare our code with Astro's and see how
and why they differ. The basic features and the advanced features provided by Astro
are tangled in the same code, so some parts of it will only make sense once we cover
the advanced features in future articles._

Once we have the HTML source, we need to parse it into DOM elements. We'll use the
native `DOMParser` API for that. We can re-use the same parser for multiple pages, but
we also don't need to instantiate it until the first time we need it, so we'll create
it lazily:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/navigation.ts"
let parser: DOMParser | undefined;

type LoadedPage = {
  doc: Document;
  redirected?: string;
};

async function loadPage(href: string, init?: RequestInit): Promise<LoadedPage | null> {
  const response = await fetchHTML(href, init);
  if (!response) return null;

  const { html, mediaType, redirected } = response;

  // Initialize the parser if it wasn't initialized yet.
  parser ??= new DOMParser();

  const doc = parser.parseFromString(html, mediaType);

  return { doc, redirected };
}
```

Good. We'll just handle a quirk of how browsers handle the HTML parsing and interpreting
differently between when the browser loads the page versus the `DOMParser` API:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/navigation.ts"
  /// Comment from Astro's source code:
  // The next line might look like a hack,
  // but it is actually necessary as noscript elements
  // and their contents are returned as markup by the parser,
  // see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser/parseFromString
doc.querySelectorAll('noscript').forEach((el) => el.remove());

return { doc, redirected };
```

## Switching the page content

Now that we have the new page loaded, our last mission for this article is to switch the
page content in place during a transition. Navigation can also be triggered by JavaScript
code, so we need to provide a function for those cases to trigger our new navigation
instead of the browser's navigation. We'll use the same entry point for both of those:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/index.ts"
export async function navigateTo(url: string) {
  const loadedPage = await loadPage(url);
  if (!loadedPage) return;

  const { doc, redirected } = loadedPage;

  function updateDOM() {
    // Add the new url to the browser's history
    history.pushState({}, '', redirected ?? url);

    document.documentElement.replaceWith(doc.documentElement);
  }

  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    // If the browser doesn't support startViewTransition, just update the DOM.
    updateDOM();
    return;
  }

  const transition = document.startViewTransition(() => updateDOM());

  await transition.finished;
}
```

We start by loading the page, and if it is not an HTML page, we just return, there is
nothing we can do about it. If it is an HTML page, we parse it and get the new document
and the final URL. Then, we check if the browser supports the `startViewTransition` API.
If it doesn't, we just update the DOM and return. If it does, we start a transition and
update the DOM within the transition.

We can re-export it from our client `index.ts`:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/index.ts"
export { navigateTo } from './navigation';
```

On our component we can now replace the `alert` call with a call to `navigateTo`:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/component.astro" ins={1,7} del={6}
import { navigateTo } from './client';

// ... existing code

// Navigate to the link
alert(`Would navigate to: ${link.href}`);
navigateTo(href);
```

And, with that, we have a working `<ViewTransitions />` component! Try it out!

The component we just implemented has all the basic functionality to work for the blog
template. Well... at least for completely static pages, with no client-side JavaScript,
no forms, no astro islands, no nothing. And also going back and forth in the browser
history no longer works for the site. And it doesn't have of the interesting features
like prefetching and persisting state between pages. But it is a start!

## Spoiler: Back and forward navigation

We can do quick fix at least for one of those issues before we wrap up this article. Let's
patch up the back and forward navigation so we can explore the blog with our new
component more easily. We can do that by listening to the `popstate` event on the
`window` object:

```ts title="src/components/viewTransitions/client/navigation.ts"
function onPopState(ev: PopStateEvent) {
  navigateTo(location.href);
}

if (!import.meta.env.SSR) {
    addEventListener('popstate', onPopState);
}
```

There is a bunch of details that we are ignoring here, but for now we'll just make our
one use case for back and forward navigation work. We'll cover the details in the next
article in this series.

## Conclusion

In this article we started building our own `<ViewTransitions />` component from scratch.
It has the basic functionality to intercept navigation events and replace the entire page
document with the new page. It is a good start, but it is far from feature-complete.

In the next article we'll properly handle history navigation, detect and handle
transitions between pages in the site without our component and pages with our component,
and add somo support for Astro's control attributes for customizing the transition.

The entire source code described in this article is
