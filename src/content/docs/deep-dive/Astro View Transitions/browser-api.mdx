<RequireViewTransition />

The browser View Transitions API is intended for a much more generic use case than
Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` component. Its purpose is to provide an easier way to make
transitions between two DOM states without having to worry about intermediary states.

Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` component is one application if this API. It provides the
wiring to turn all navigation between static Astro pages into a transition between two
DOM states in the same page, providing the experience of an SPA without require all
the complexity and piles of JavaScript that would be required for doing that more
generally.

But while Astro's component is for navigation, the browser API can be used for many more
use cases, even simpler ones. In order to understand how Astro's component works and the
reasoning behind some of its design decisions, it is important to understand the browser
API first.

## The world before: madness

To understand the problem that this API is trying to solve, let's pretend we are tasked
with building a component that shows one image and when you click on it, it switches
to another image. We'll gradually take care of more details in that component so we can
experience the problems that arise without using the View Transitions API before we switch
to using it.

Laying the groundwork, let's start with a simple component that includes the two images
and
when you click on one of them it hides it and shows the other one. We'll use the
`<Image />` component from Astro's `astro:assets` package to load the images.

### Simplest image swap

:::note
This snippet and the others that follow from it are simplified examples of the code used
throughout this page. It assumes a static page without Astro's View Transitions, and also
that there is only one use of the component in the page due to the hard-coded `id`.

This site does use Astro's View Transition and there are multiple demos along the page, so
the real code is a bit more complex. If you want to see the real code used here, you can
check the [source code]. Such differences will be explained in following articles.
:::

```astro
---
import coast from '@/assets/jungle-coast.jpg';
import bird from '@/assets/tree-bird.jpg';
import {Image} from 'astro:assets';
---

<div id="images">
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}} alt="Tree bird" src={bird} />
</div>

<script>
    function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
        const imgs = parent.querySelectorAll('img');
    
        imgs.forEach(img => {
            img.style.display = img.style.display === 'none'
              ? 'block' : 'none';
        });
    }
    
    const images = document.getElementById('images');
    
    images.addEventListener('click', () => {
      swapImages(images);
    });
</script>
```

Let's break down what is happening in that code:

- We have two images, one of a jungle coast and another of a bird on a tree.
- The bird image is initially hidden.
- We have an event listener that listens for clicks on the `#images` element that contains
  both images. When a click happens, it calls the `swapImages` function with the
  `#images` element as argument.
- The `swapImages` function swaps the visibility of all the `img` elements within the
  given container, hiding the ones that are visible and showing the ones that are
  hidden.

Quite a simple and straighforward component, right? Let's see it in action:

<SimpleSwap />

That is good enough for a first version, but it has some problems:

1. The first image is hidden immediately when you click on it, but the second image
   only starts loading after that. This is because the `<Image/>` component has a very
   useful default of lazy loading images. This is great for performance, but it means
   that there will be a gap in time with no image being shown.

   _Try setting a very low network speed in your browser's dev tools and clicking on the
   image again to see this effect._
2. The swap is immediate. There is no transition between the two images, they just
   suddenly disappear and appear. Once both images are loaded, the image appears to
   abruptly becomes the other.

### Don't wait for the next image

We can fix the first problem by setting the `loading="eager"` attribute on the second
image. This will make it load immediately instead of lazily. This fixes the symptom, but
not the problem. If we had more images, we would not want to load all of them eagerly,
only the one that is going to be shown next.

```astro ins={7}
<div id="images">
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image
    style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}}
    alt="Tree bird"
    src={bird}
    loading="eager"
  />
</div>
```

<SimpleSwapEager>
  The second image from here on is different so the browser doesn't share the cache with
  the demo above.
</SimpleSwapEager>

### Animating the swap

As for the second problem, we can add an animation during the swap using `img.animate`.
It would need two animations, one to fade out the current image and another to fade in
the new one.

To do that, we can call animate on each image, passing two keyframes,
one describing the opacity of the image before the swap and another describing the
opacity after the swap. We can also pass an options object with the duration and easing
of the animation. Let's try that:

```ts ins={5-9,12-16}
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      img.style.display = 'none';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-out' },
      );
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithFlickerAnimation />

Wait, what happened there? The image flickered! It was supposed to fade out, but it
disappeared immediately and then faded in. What happened?

### The problem with animation and style changes

The problem here is that animations are asynchronous, but style changes are synchronous.
When we call `img.animate`, it returns an animation object that is scheduled to run,
it doesn't run immediately (in fact it doesn't even start running until JS is idle).
But when we set `img.style.display = 'none'`, that hides the image immediately, before
even the assignment completes in JavaScript.

So we are hiding the image, and animating its fade out while it is already not visible.
Definetely not what we wanted. You might even say it looks worse than without the
animation since now it _always_ look janky, not just on the first swap.

Ok... We can fix that! `img.animate` returns an animation object, and that has
an `onfinish` property that is a callback for after the animation ends. We can use that
to hide the image only after the animation has already faded out the image completely.

```ts ins={17-19} ins="const animation ="
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      const animation = img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-out' },
      );

      animation.onfinish = () => {
        img.style.display = 'none';
      };
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithTiledAnimation />

WHAAT? Now the images are tiled above each other! Well, we should expect that... We are
now showing both images at the same time, so they will show up just like they would if
both were always visible. Both animating, one with fade out and the other with fade in,
but both visible, separately, at the same time.

### Superimposing old state and new state

We need to fade out the old image while fading in the new one _in the same space_ on the
screen. We need to superimpose the two images on top of each other, and then run the
animations on both of them at the same time.

Here enters some style trickery, we set the `position` of the container to `relative`
so we can position the images relative to it without considering the normal element flow
of the page.

```astro ins="style={{position: 'relative'}}"
<div id="images" style={{position: 'relative'}}>
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image
    style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}}
    alt="Tree bird"
    src={bird}
    loading="eager"
  />
</div>
```

Then, when an image is fading out we set its `position` to `absolute` and set its `top`
and `left` to `0` so it is positioned at the begginning of the container, which will
be the same position as the new image. This way, the old image will be superimposed
on top of the new one, and we can fade it out while fading in the new one.

The new image will still be positioned using the normal flow of the page, this ensures
that the container and anything that follows it will not shrink to zero height during
the transition. We clear these position styles after the animation is finished so the
next swap will work as expected.

```ts ins={13-15,30-32}
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      // Restyle the image to it is positioned on top of the other one
      // outside of the normal flow.
      img.style.position = 'absolute';
      img.style.top = '0';
      img.style.left = '0';

      const animation = img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        {
          duration: 1000,
          easing: 'ease-out',
        },
      );

      animation.onfinish = () => {
        // Once the animation is finished, hide the image and reset its style
        // so the container never changes size.
        img.style.display = 'none';
        img.style.position = null;
        img.style.top = null;
        img.style.left = null;
      };
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithAnimation />

BEAUTIFUL! Now we have a nice fade out and fade in animation between the two images.
Job done, right? Well, not quite... Click twice fast on the image and you'll see that the
entire thing breaks. Both images disappear and never come back. What happened?

### The user is impatient

We have a people problem now. The user is the biggest force of chaos in the world,
whatever
you didn't think of testing will be used by someone:

<center>
![xkcd about workflow](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png)
</center>

In this case, the user is impatient and clicked on the image before the animation was
finished. This triggered another set of animations to start, but the first set was not
canceled, so now we have four animations running at the same time:

- Fading out the first image
- Fading in the second image
- Fading out the second image
- Fading in the first image

Since both images started a fade out animation, they both are positioned
using `position: 'absolute'`, so there is nothing in the normal flow inside the container,
making it collapse to zero size. At the end of those fade out animations, both images
are hidden completely, so the container remains collapsed. With the container collapsed,
we can't click on it anymore (it has size zero), so the user can't trigger another swap.

We need to prevent any new animation from starting while there is one already running.
To do that, we set a flag when we start an animation and clear it when the animation
finished. Before starting a new animation, we check if the flag is set and if it is,
we don't start the animation.

```ts ins={2,4,37}
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  if (parent.dataset.state === 'animating') return;

  parent.dataset.state = 'animating';

  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      // Restyle the image to it is positioned on top of the other one
      // outside of the normal flow.
      img.style.position = 'absolute';
      img.style.top = '0';
      img.style.left = '0';

      const animation = img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        {
          duration: 1000,
          easing: 'ease-out',
        },
      );

      animation.onfinish = () => {
        // Once the animation is finished, hide the image and reset its style
        // so the container never changes size.
        img.style.display = 'none';
        img.style.position = null;
        img.style.top = null;
        img.style.left = null;
        parent.dataset.state = null;
      };
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithSynchronizedAnimation />

Great! Now we have a nice animation that works even if the user is impatient and clicks
multiple times. Is this it? Is this the final version? Well, it is good enough for the
point I'm making here. When transitioning between two states, we need to take care of
many details that are not obvious at first. We need to think about the order of
operations, the timing of the animations, the position of the elements, how to juggle both
states simulteneously in the same space, how to do that without breaking everything else
in the page, and so on. And this is just a simple component with two images, imagine
doing that for a whole page with many elements and many states.

I am, by no means, and I do mean _no means_, an expert in CSS and animations. In fact,
I'm not even a frontend developer, I only do backend stuff professionally. I'm sure
there are many things that could be done better in this component. But the point is that
it is not easy to get right, and it is not easy to get right in a way that is reusable
and maintainable.

## The world after: View Transitions API

The browser View Transitions API is intended to help with those sort of scenarios. It
kinda follows the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well". It doesn't try to do
everything, it just does ONE thing: make transitions between two DOM states without
having to worry about intermediary states.

The API is incredibly simple, on its JavaScript side it is just a single method and an
object
with three promise handles:

```ts
interface Document {
  startViewTransition(updateCallback: () => Promise<void> | void): ViewTransition;
}

interface ViewTransition {
  finished: Promise<void>;

  ready: Promise<void>;

  updateCallbackDone: Promise<void>;

  skipTransition(): void;
}
```

That's it, that is the entire API. What is so magical about it? Well, let's see it in
action. Remember that very first example we had? The one that just swapped the images
without any animation? Let's see what happens when we wrap that in a call to
`document.startViewTransition`:

```astro ins={25} ins="document.startViewTransition"
---
import coast from '@/assets/jungle-coast.jpg';
import bird from '@/assets/tree-bird.jpg';
import {Image} from 'astro:assets';
---

<div id="images">
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image
    style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}}
    alt="Tree bird"
    src={bird}
    loading="eager"
  />
</div>

<script>
    function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
        const imgs = parent.querySelectorAll('img');
    
        imgs.forEach(img => {
            img.style.display = img.style.display === 'none'
              ? 'block' : 'none';
        });
    }
    
    const images = document.getElementById('images');
    
    images.addEventListener('click', () => {
      document.startViewTransition(() => swapImages(images));
    });
</script>
```

<AnimatedWithTransition />

Aaaand it works... Just that. It works. It swaps the images with a smooth transition
between
them. No flickering, no jank, no collapsing container, no more messing with styles to
superimpose the images, nor worrying about the order of operations.

### HOW?!

Finally, the question proposed at the beginning of this article. How does it work?
When we call `document.startViewTransition`, it goes through a few steps:

1. The browser immediately takes a snapshot of the entire DOM state and shows that
   snapshot on top of the real DOM as the pseudo-element
   `::view-transition-old(scope)`.
2. It then calls the `updateCallback` function we passed to it. This function can update
   the DOM however it wants, switching directly to the new state without worrying about
   intermediary states.
3. Once that function returns (or the promise it returns resolves), the API takes another
   snapshot of the DOM and also show it on top of the page, but below the old state. This
   is added with the pseudo-element `::view-transition-new(scope)`.
4. It then starts an animation that fades out the old state and fades in the new one.
   You can use those pseudo-elements to style the transition however you want, be it by
   changing the animation, the duration, the easing, or even the position of the elements
   in thoes pseudo-states.

But what is that `scope` thing? It is an identifier so you can style multiple portions
of the DOM state transition differently. By default, any change to any element goes to
the `root` scope, but you can style an element so it is added to a different scope. This
allows you to have, for example, one element that takes slightly longer to fade in than
everything else on the page.

With that we can see how the problems we had before are solved:

- This is an entirely asynchronous API, so we can delay the entire thing until the new
  image is loaded. We can even show a loading indicator while the image is loading.
- The snapshot of the DOM being shown on top of the document allows us to switch the
  style of the images without them flickering in front of the user.
- There can only be one running transition at a time, so we don't have to worry about
  the user clicking multiple times and breaking everything.
- Since both pseudo-elements are independent snapshots of the entire DOM, we don't need
  to handle special positioning of the elements, they are already positioned exactly
  as they should be.

## How does this tie in with Astro?

Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` component is a wrapper around this API, but it has a much
bigger goal. That component is intended to make all navigation between static Astro pages
behave like an SPA, transitioning between the pages and allowing state to be persisted
between pages.

Than why tie them both together? What makes this API special for Astro's use case that it
deserves to have the component named after it?

This API is very simple, but it enables a whole new world of possibilites. For example,
what if we switch, one by one, each element in a page's `<head>` section? This would
change the style of the entire page and its metadata, but thanks to this API this can
be done without any flickering for the user since the browser will show the old state
until everything is ready to be shown at once.

What if we change _every_ element in the page? Like, with all the elements of _another_
page that we `fetch`ed from the server? Same experience as an SPA, but without all the
complexity of an SPA.

Those are some of the things that Astro builds on top of this API. To understand how all
those and others features, check back here for the following articles. In the next one,
we'll start building a simplified version of Astro' s `<ViewTransitions />` component from
scratch, step by step, so we can understand how it doesn all its magic.
