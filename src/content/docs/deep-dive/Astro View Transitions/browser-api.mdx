<RequireViewTransition mode="demo" />

The browser View Transitions API is intended for a much more generic use case than
Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` component. Its purpose is to provide an easier transition
between two DOM states without worrying about intermediary states.

Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` component is one application of this API. It provides the
wiring to turn all navigation between static Astro pages into a transition between two DOM
states on the same page, providing the experience of a SPA without requiring all the
complexity and piles of JavaScript that would be necessary for doing that more generally.

But while Astro's component is for navigation, the browser API can be used for many more
use cases, even simpler ones. It is essential to understand the browser API first to
understand how Astro's component works and the reasoning behind some of its design
decisions.

## The world before: madness

To understand the problem this API is trying to solve, let's pretend we are tasked with
building a component that shows one image and switches to a different image when you click
on it. We'll gradually take care of more details in that component so we can experience
the problems that arise without using the View Transitions API before we switch to using
it.

Laying the groundwork, let's start with a simple component that includes the two images,
and when you click on one, it hides it and shows the other. We'll load the images using
the `<Image />` component from Astro's `astro:assets` package.

### Simplest image swap

:::note
This snippet and the others following it are simplified examples of the code used
throughout this page. It assumes a static page without Astro's View Transitions, and there
is only one use of the component in the page due to the hard-coded `id`.

This site does use Astro's View Transition, and there are multiple demos along the page,
so the actual code is a bit more complex. If you want to see the code used here, you can
check the [source code]. Such differences will be explained in the following articles.
:::

```astro
---
import coast from '@/assets/jungle-coast.jpg';
import bird from '@/assets/tree-bird.jpg';
import {Image} from 'astro:assets';
---

<div id="images">
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}} alt="Tree bird" src={bird} />
</div>

<script>
    function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
        const imgs = parent.querySelectorAll('img');
    
        imgs.forEach(img => {
            img.style.display = img.style.display === 'none'
              ? 'block' : 'none';
        });
    }
    
    const images = document.getElementById('images');
    
    images.addEventListener('click', () => {
      swapImages(images);
    });
</script>
```

Let's break down what is happening in that code:

- We have two images, one of a jungle coast and another of a bird on a tree.
- The bird image is initially hidden.
- We have an event listener that listens for clicks on the `#images` element that contains
  both images. When a click happens, it calls the `swapImages` function with the `#images`
  element as its argument.
- The `swapImages` function swaps the visibility of all the `img` elements within the
  given container, hiding the ones that are visible and showing the ones that are hidden.

It's a pretty straightforward component, right? Let's see it in action:

<SimpleSwap />

That is good enough for a first version, but it has some problems:

1. The first image is immediately hidden when you click on it, but the second image only
   starts loading afterward. This is because the `<Image/>` component has a handy default
   of lazy loading images. This is great for performance, but there will be a time gap
   with no image.

   _Try setting a meager network speed in your browser's dev tools and clicking on the
   image again to see this effect._
2. The swap is immediate. There is no transition between the two images; they just
   suddenly disappear and appear. Once both images are loaded, the image appears to
   abruptly become the other.

### Don't wait for the next image

We can fix the first problem by setting the `loading="eager"` attribute on the second
image. This will make it load immediately instead of lazily. This fixes the symptom but
not the problem. If we had more images, we would not want to load all of them eagerly,
only the one that will be shown next.

```astro ins={7}
<div id="images">
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image
    style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}}
    alt="Tree bird"
    src={bird}
    loading="eager"
  />
</div>
```

<SimpleSwapEager>
  The second image from here on is different, so the browser doesn't share the cache with
  the demo above.
</SimpleSwapEager>

### Animating the swap

As for the second problem, we can add an animation during the swap using `img.animate`. It
would need two animations, one to fade out the current image and another to fade in the
new one.

To do that, we can call animate on each image, passing two keyframes, one describing the
opacity of the image before the swap and another describing the opacity after the swap. We
can also pass an options object with the duration and easing of the animation. Let's try
this:

```ts ins={5-9,12-16}
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      img.style.display = 'none';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-out' },
      );
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithFlickerAnimation />

Wait, what happened there? The image flickered! It was supposed to fade out, but it
disappeared immediately and then faded in. What happened?

### The problem with animation and style changes

The problem is that animations are asynchronous, but style changes are synchronous. When
we call `img.animate`, it schedules the animation to run and immediately returns a handle
for it; the animation doesn't run immediately (in fact, it doesn't start until JS is
idle). But when we set `img.style.display = 'none'`, it hides the image immediately
before even the assignment is completed in JavaScript.

So we are hiding the image, and animating its fade out while it is already not visible.
Definitely not what we wanted. You might even say it looks worse than without the
animation since now it _always_ looks janky, not just on the first swap.

Ok... We can fix that! `img.animate` returns an animation object with an `onfinish`
property that is a callback for after the animation ends. We can use that to hide the
image only after the animation has already faded out the image completely.

```ts ins={17-19} ins="const animation ="
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      const animation = img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-out' },
      );

      animation.onfinish = () => {
        img.style.display = 'none';
      };
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithTiledAnimation />

WHAAT? Now the images are tiled above each other! Well, we should expect that... We now
show both images at the same time, so they appear as if both were always visible. Both are
animating, one with fade out and the other with fade in, but both are visible separately,
simultaneously.

### Superimposing old state and new state

We need to fade out the old image while fading in the new one _in the same space_ on the
screen. We need to superimpose the two images on top of each other and then run the
animations on both simultaneously.

Here, we invoke some style trickery. We set the `position` of the container to `relative`
so we can position the images relative to it without considering the normal element flow
of the page.

```astro ins="style={{position: 'relative'}}"
<div id="images" style={{position: 'relative'}}>
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image
    style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}}
    alt="Tree bird"
    src={bird}
    loading="eager"
  />
</div>
```

Then, when an image is fading out, we set its `position` to `absolute` and set its `top`
and `left` to `0` so it is positioned at the beginning of the container, which will be in
the same position as the new image. This way, the old image will be superimposed on top of
the new one, and we can fade it out while fading in the new one.

The new image will still be positioned using the normal flow of the page, this ensures
that the container and anything that follows it will not shrink to zero height during the
transition. After the animation, we have to clear these position styles so the next swap
works as expected.

```ts ins={13-15,30-32}
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      // Restyle the image to it is positioned on top of the other one
      // outside of the normal flow.
      img.style.position = 'absolute';
      img.style.top = '0';
      img.style.left = '0';

      const animation = img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        {
          duration: 1000,
          easing: 'ease-out',
        },
      );

      animation.onfinish = () => {
        // Once the animation is finished, hide the image and reset its style
        // so the container never changes size.
        img.style.display = 'none';
        img.style.position = null;
        img.style.top = null;
        img.style.left = null;
      };
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithAnimation />

BEAUTIFUL! Now, we have a nice fade-out and fade-in animation between the two images. Job
done, right? Well, not quite... Click twice fast on the image. You'll see that the
entire thing breaks. Both images disappear and never come back. What happened?

### The user is impatient

We have a people problem now. The user is the biggest force of chaos in the world.
Whatever you didn't think of testing will be used by someone:

<center>
![xkcd about workflow](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/workflow.png)
</center>

In this case, the user was impatient and clicked on the image before the animation was
finished. This triggered another set of animations to start, but the first set was not
canceled, so now we have four animations running at the same time:

- Fading out the first image
- Fading in the second image
- Fading out the second image
- Fading in the first image

Since both images started a fade-out animation, they are positioned
using `position: 'absolute'`, so there is nothing in the normal flow inside the container,
making it collapse to zero size. At the end of those fade-out animations, both images are
hidden completely, so the container remains collapsed. With the container collapsed, we
can't click on it anymore (it has a size of zero), so the user can't trigger another swap.

We must prevent any new animation from starting while one is already running. To do that,
we set a flag when we create an animation and clear it when it is finished. Before
starting a new animation, we check if the flag is set, and if it is, we don't create the
animation.

```ts ins={2,4,37}
function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
  if (parent.dataset.state === 'animating') return;

  parent.dataset.state = 'animating';

  parent.querySelectorAll('img').forEach(img => {
    if (img.style.display === 'none') {
      img.style.display = 'inline';
      img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 0 to 1 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
        { duration: 1000, easing: 'ease-in' },
      );
    } else {
      // Restyle the image to it is positioned on top of the other one
      // outside of the normal flow.
      img.style.position = 'absolute';
      img.style.top = '0';
      img.style.left = '0';

      const animation = img.animate(
        // Transition from opacity 1 to 0 over 1 second.
        [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
        {
          duration: 1000,
          easing: 'ease-out',
        },
      );

      animation.onfinish = () => {
        // Once the animation is finished, hide the image and reset its style
        // so the container never changes size.
        img.style.display = 'none';
        img.style.position = null;
        img.style.top = null;
        img.style.left = null;
        parent.dataset.state = null;
      };
    }
  });
}
```

<SwapWithSynchronizedAnimation />

Great! We now have a nice animation working even if the user is impatient and clicks
multiple times. Is this it? Is this the final version? Well, it is good enough for the
point I'm making here. When transitioning between two states, we need to take care of many
details that are not initially obvious. We need to think about the order of operations,
the timing of the animations, the position of the elements, how to juggle both states
simultaneously in the same space, how to do that without breaking everything else on the
page, and so on. This is just a simple component with two images; imagine doing that for a
whole page with many elements and states (that is one of the reasons the code of many SPA
frameworks are so complicated).

I am, by no means, and I do mean _no means_, an expert in CSS and animations. In fact, I'm
not even a frontend developer; I only do backend professionally. I'm sure many things
could be done better in this component. But the point is that it is not easy to get
right, and it is especially difficult to get right in a reusable and maintainable way.

## The world after: View Transitions API

The browser View Transitions API is intended to help with those scenarios. It kinda
follows the Unix philosophy of "do one thing and do it well". It doesn't try to do
everything, it just does ONE thing: make transitions between two DOM states without
worrying about intermediary states.

The API is exceedingly simple; on its JavaScript side, it is just a single method and an
object with three promise handles:

```ts
interface Document {
  startViewTransition(updateCallback: () => Promise<void> | void): ViewTransition;
}

interface ViewTransition {
  finished: Promise<void>;

  ready: Promise<void>;

  updateCallbackDone: Promise<void>;

  skipTransition(): void;
}
```

That's it, that is the entire API. What is so magical about it? Well, let's see it in
action. Remember that very first example we had? The one that just swapped the images
without any animation? Let's see what happens when we wrap that in a call to
`document.startViewTransition`:

```astro ins={25} ins="document.startViewTransition"
---
import coast from '@/assets/jungle-coast.jpg';
import bird from '@/assets/tree-bird.jpg';
import {Image} from 'astro:assets';
---

<div id="images">
  <Image style={{margin: '0'}} alt="Jungle coast" src={coast} />
  <Image
    style={{display: 'none', margin: '0'}}
    alt="Tree bird"
    src={bird}
    loading="eager"
  />
</div>

<script>
    function swapImages(parent: HTMLElement) {
        const imgs = parent.querySelectorAll('img');
    
        imgs.forEach(img => {
            img.style.display = img.style.display === 'none'
              ? 'block' : 'none';
        });
    }
    
    const images = document.getElementById('images');
    
    images.addEventListener('click', () => {
      document.startViewTransition(() => swapImages(images));
    });
</script>
```

<AnimatedWithTransition />

Aaaand it works... Just that. It works. It swaps the images with a smooth transition
between them. No flickering, no jank, no collapsing container, no more messing with
styles to superimpose the images, nor worrying about the order of operations.

### HOW?

Finally, the question proposed at the beginning of this article. How does it work? When we
call `document.startViewTransition`, it goes through a few steps:

1. The browser immediately takes a snapshot of the entire DOM state and shows that
   snapshot on top of the real DOM as the pseudo-element `::view-transition-old(scope)`.
2. It then calls the `updateCallback` function we passed to it. This function can update
   the DOM however it wants, switching directly to the new state without worrying about
   intermediary states.
3. Once that function returns (or the promise it returns resolves), the API takes another
   snapshot of the DOM and shows it on top of the page but below the old state. This
   is added with the pseudo-element `::view-transition-new(scope)`.
4. It then starts an animation that fades out of the old state and fades in the new one.
   You can use those pseudo-elements to style the transition however you want, be it by
   changing the animation, the duration, the easing, or even the position of the elements
   in those pseudo-states.

But what is that `scope` thing? It is an identifier, so you can style multiple portions of
the DOM state transition differently. By default, any change to any element goes to
the `root` scope, but you can style an element so it is added to a different scope. For
example, this allows you to have one element that takes slightly longer to fade in than
everything else on the page.

With that, we can see how the problems we had before are solved:

- This is an entirely asynchronous API, so we can delay until the new image is loaded. We
  can even show a loading indicator while the image is loading.
- The snapshot of the DOM being shown on top of the document allows us to switch the style
  of the images without them flickering in front of the user.
- There can only be one running transition at a time, so we don't have to worry about the
  user clicking multiple times and breaking everything.
- Since both pseudo-elements are independent snapshots of the entire DOM, we don't need to
  handle the unique positioning of the elements. They are already positioned precisely
  where they should be.

## How does this tie in with Astro?

Astro's `<ViewTransitions />` component is a wrapper around this API but has a much bigger
goal. That component is intended to make all navigation between static Astro pages behave
like a SPA, transitioning between the pages and allowing state to persist between pages.

Then why tie them both together? What makes this API so special for Astro's use case that
it deserves to have the component named after it?

The browser API might be simple on the surface, but it enables a whole new world of
possibilities. For example, what if we switch, one by one, each element in a
page's `<head>` section? This would change the style of the entire page and its metadata,
but thanks to this API, this can be done without any flickering for the user since the
browser will show the old state until everything is ready to be shown at once.

What if we change _every_ element on the page? Like, with all the elements of _another_
page that we `fetch`ed from the server? It's the same experience as a SPA but without all
the complexity of a SPA.

Those are some of the things that Astro builds on top of this API. To understand how all
those features and others work, check back here for the following articles. In the next
one, we'll start building a simplified version of Astro' s `<ViewTransitions />` component
from scratch, step by step, so we can understand how it does all its magic.
