Today I was observing the clouds through the window of an airplane.
It got me into a strange and deep pondering.

Humanity has looked up to the skies, watching the clouds in awe, fear and
wonder since the beginning of our existence. Today, hundreds of thousands of
years since the first humans, 12 thousand years since the first settlements,
6 thousand years since the beginning of the common era and almost almost 250
years since we learned how to fly over the clouds in a balloon, we still look
up and wonder "will it rain today?" or say "look, that cloud looks like a bunny!".

The curiosity stemming from observing the clouds and yearning for understanding
what are they, how, when and where are they formed and will turn into rain has
guided multiple scientific discoveries throughout the years. It has expanded
from admiring the fluffy clouds here on Earth to analyzing gigantic
[nebulae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula 'Nebulas - Wikipedia'), very
sparse clouds of gas in interstellar space.

The [Cloud Chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber),
for example, was invented to study cloud formation and their optical properties
but became one of the first detectors for ionizing radiation. Nowadays, CERN
has the [CLOUD experiment](https://cloud.web.cern.ch/), an experiment dedicated
to understand the influence of cosmic rays in the clouds and the climate.

In the year 2000, the
[Clay Mathematics Institute](https://www.claymath.org/purpose-and-goals)
made a statement listing the 7 biggest problems that humanity was facing coming
into the new millennium, along with a one million dollar prize for each one.
As they described:

> The Prizes were conceived \[...\] to emphasize the importance of working
> towards a solution of the deepest, most difficult problems; and to recognize
> achievement in mathematics of historical magnitude.

One of those Millenium Problems is the existence of a solution to the
[Navierâ€“Stokes Equation](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation),
the equation that describes the movement of fluids, like the movement and
formation of, you guessed it, the clouds. Actually, the challenge is to "make
substantial progress toward a mathematical theory which will unlock the secrets
hidden in the Navier-Stokes equations". They consider it a historical achievement
not only to find solution but even just making progress in that direction.

Our understanding of the universe, from the smallest to the largest
structures, from the deepest atmospheres to the farthest edge of the
observable universe, was developed, among many, many other things, with
the base of a simple understanding of the laws of physics of interacting
particles. Nowadays any hobbyist is capable of shooting a laser from their backyard
at the moon with enough precision to hit a single reflector left there half a century
ago and then measure the reflected light. But even coming this far we still get out of our
houses and wonder if we should bring an umbrella.

If asked, I'd say this curiosity is what brought us this far. And this desire to
understand the world around us is what drives these discoveries and whats gonna
bring us further. It comes from all sorts of problems from the trivial ones
around us to some of the deepest unsolved problems in mathematics.

So, next time you look at some clouds, think about how much this simple act
has moved humanity over our history, inspiring from multiple religions to
hundreds of scientific discoveries. And if it rains, thats good, it demarks a
new revolution of a cycle that we have just recently started to comprehend.
