Today I was observing the clouds through the window of an airplane. It got me into a strange and deep pondering.

Humanity has looked up to the skies, watching the clouds in awe, fear and wonder since the beginning of our existence. Today, hundreds of thousands of years since the first humans, 12 thousand years since the first settlements, 6 thousand years since the beginning of the common era and almost almost 250 years since we learned how to fly over the clouds in a balloon, we still look up and wonder "will it rain today?" or say "look, that cloud looks like a bunny!".

The curiosity stemming from observing the clouds and yearning for understanding what are they, how, when and where are they formed and will turn into rain has guided multiple scientific discoveries throughout the years. It has expanded from admiring the fluffy clouds here on Earth to analyzing gigantic [nebulas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula "Nebulas - Wikipedia"), very sparse clouds of gas in interstellar space.

The [cloud chamber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_chamber "Cloud chamber"), for example, was invented to study cloud formation and heir optical properties but became one of the first detectors for ionizing radiation. Nowadays, CERN has the [CLOUD experiment](https://cloud.web.cern.ch/), an experiment dedicated to understand the influence of cosmic rays in the clouds and the climate.

In the year 2000, the [Clay Mathematics Institute](https://www.claymath.org/purpose-and-goals) made a statement listing the 7 biggest problems that humanity was facing coming into the new millenium, along with a one million dollar prize for each one. As they described:

> The Prizes were conceived \[...\] to emphasize the importance of working towards a solution of the deepest, most difficult problems; and to recognize achievement in mathematics of historical magnitude.

One of those Millenium Problems is the existence of a solution to the [Navierâ€“Stokes Equation](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/navier%E2%80%93stokes-equation), the equation that describes the movement of fluids, like the movement and formation of clouds something that we all see every day. Actually, the challenge is to "make substantial progress toward a mathematical theory which will unlock the secrets hidden in the Navier-Stokes equations", not even to find a solution but just making progress in that.

We have advanced to the point that any hobbyist can shoot a laser from their backyard at the moon with enough precision to hit a single reflector left there 50 years ago and measure their reflectiveness. And yet we still get out of our houses and wonder if we should bring an umbrella.
