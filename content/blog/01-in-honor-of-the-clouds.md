Today I was observing the clouds through the window of an airplane. It got me into a strange and deep pondering.

Humanity has looked up to the skies, watching the clouds in awe, fear and wonder since the beginning of our existence. Today, hundreds of thousands of years since the first humans, 12 thousand years since the first settlements, 6 thousand years since the beginning of the common era and almost almost 400 years since we learned how to fly over the clouds in a balloon, we stil look up and wonder "will it rain today?" or say "look, that cloud looks like a bunny!".

The curiosity steming from observing the clouds and yearning for understanding what are they, how, when and where are they formed and will turn into rain has guided multiple scientific discoveries throughout the years. The "Cloud Chamber", a device created to study the formation and behavior of the clouds revealed traces of cosmic rays and the presence of radiation.

The study of clouds revealed properties of the universe that allowed us to encounter the missing half of all the matter as part of the galactic filaments, sparse tunnels of gas between the galaxies. Allowed us to understand the dynamics of the accretion disk in black holes and the titanic radio lobes generate by them that are multiple times the size of our Galaxy.

In the early 2000s the Clay Institute, one of the most renowned research facilities of the world, made a statement listing the 9 biggest discoveries that humanity was expected to achieve in the next millennium. With all the speed of progress that our society has achieved, they considered that those 9 problems might still take a full 1000 years to solve and would be so significant that they would be the biggest achievements.

Nuclear fusion, colonies in the moon or in other planets, all renewable energy sources and becoming a type 1 civilization on the Kardashev scale? All of those are expected to happen in _less_ than a thousand years, and none of those made it to that list. That is to show how incredible those challenges are. And yet 2 of them are related to the movement of the clouds. Two of the _challenges of the millenium_ are related to clouds, something that we've all been seen daily for the entire history of our species.

We have advanced to the point that any hobbyist can shoot a laser from their backyard at the moon with enough precision to hit a single reflector left there 50 years ago and measure their reflectiveness. And yet we still get out of our houses and wonder if we should bring an umbrella.
